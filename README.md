## About the Project 📝 <a name="about-the-project"></a>

This repository contains a series of exercises and projects that demonstrate key concepts in low-level programming. These projects were part of the ALX Software Engineering program and helped solidify my understanding of C programming and system-level development.

## Features ✨ <a name="features"></a>

- **Memory Management:** Understanding and implementing dynamic memory allocation.
- **Pointers and Arrays:** Mastering the use of pointers and arrays for efficient data manipulation.
- **Data Structures:** Implementing fundamental data structures such as linked lists, stacks, and queues.
- **Function Pointers:** Utilizing function pointers to create flexible and reusable code components.

## Technologies Used 🛠️ <a name="technologies-used"></a>

- **C Programming Language:** The core language used for all projects.
- **GNU Compiler Collection (GCC):** The compiler used to build and test the code.
- **Valgrind:** A tool for memory debugging, memory leak detection, and profiling.

## Getting Started 🚀 <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

- GCC Compiler
- Make
- Valgrind (for memory debugging)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gasimhacker/alx-low_level_programming.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd alx-low_level_programming
    ```
## Usage 🖥️ <a name="usage"></a>
1. Create a C file that uses any of the functions in the project by including the header file main.h in your file:
    ```c
    #include "main.h"
    
    int main(void) {
        // Your code here
        return 0;
    }
    ```
2. Compile your code using GCC:
    ```sh
    gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic your_file.c -o your_output
    ```

3. Run the compiled program:
    ```sh
    ./your_output
    ```
